## [2.0.5] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed - CRITICAL: Setup Hanging
- **Integration setup hanging**: Fixed sensor platform taking >10 seconds
  - Issue: AI sensors were blocking setup by calling LLM immediately
  - Solution: Added `async_track_time_interval` for periodic updates
  - AI sensors now check every 15 minutes if they should update
  - Setup completes immediately, updates happen in background
- **Deprecated config_entry warning**: Removed explicit assignment
  - Fixed: "sets option flow config_entry explicitly" warning
  - Removed `self.config_entry = config_entry` (available from parent)
  - Prepares for Home Assistant 2025.12

### Changed
- AI sensors now use `async_track_time_interval` for updates
- Check every 15 minutes, but only update based on sensor schedule
- Daily insights: Once per day at 6 AM
- Solar coach: Every 15 minutes (if conditions met)
- Bill forecast: Daily
- Weekly story: Weekly
- Setup no longer blocked by AI sensor initialization

### Technical
- Added `async_track_time_interval` import
- Added `_async_scheduled_update` method to base AI sensor
- Each sensor's `async_update()` has its own time checks
- Removed blocking `await self.async_update()` from `async_added_to_hass`
- Config flow now uses inherited `self.config_entry`

**Integration should now load in <10 seconds! AI updates happen in background!**

## [2.0.4] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed - CRITICAL BUGS
- **Binary sensor/switch crash**: Fixed `'coroutine' object is not subscriptable` error
  - Issue: `sense_energy` library's `get_discovered_device_data()` is broken
  - Solution: Use `gateway.devices` directly instead
  - Affected: binary_sensor.py and switch.py platforms
- **AI sensors stuck in "pending"**: Fixed AI sensors not updating
  - Added `async_added_to_hass()` to trigger initial update
  - Simplified AI sensor creation (no feature checking)
  - All 7 AI sensors now added when AI enabled
  - Better logging to show which sensors are created

### Changed
- Binary sensors now use `gateway.devices` attribute
- Switch platform uses `gateway.devices` with proper `getattr()` calls
- AI sensors trigger update immediately when added to HA
- Better logging: "Adding AI sensors (provider: openai)"

### Technical
- Workaround for broken `get_discovered_device_data()` in sense_energy library
- AI sensors now properly call their `async_update()` method on startup
- Removed feature-based filtering (all AI sensors added when enabled)

**Binary sensors and switches should now work! AI sensors should start generating!**

## [2.0.3] - 2025-10-16

### Changed - UX Improvements
- **Cleaner Config UI**: Removed overlapping text, better labels
- **AI Provider Selection**: Changed from checkbox to dropdown
  - "Disabled - No AI Features" (default)
  - "Home Assistant Conversation (Free - Uses your default agent)"
  - "OpenAI Integration (Requires API key)" - only shown if installed
  - "Anthropic Conversation (Requires API key)" - only shown if installed
- **Removed "Built-in" AI**: There's no such thing as free AI, removed misleading option
- **Dynamic Options**: Token budget only shown when AI provider selected
- **Better Labels**: Changed from variable names to user-friendly text
  - "ai_enabled" â†’ removed (now implicit based on provider)
  - "ai_provider" â†’ "AI Provider"
  - "ai_token_budget" â†’ "Monthly Token Budget"
  - "realtime_update_rate" â†’ "Real-time Update Rate"

### Fixed

## [1.3.3] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: `gateway.rate_limit` now uses user-configured rate instead of hardcoded 60s
- The official library's WebSocket rate limiting was always 60s regardless of settings
- Now properly applies your chosen update rate (5s, 10s, etc.)

### Technical
- Moved `realtime_update_rate` calculation to top of `async_setup_entry`
- Set `gateway.rate_limit = realtime_update_rate` (was using `ACTIVE_UPDATE_RATE` constant)
- Added logging: "Using official sense_energy library with Xs update rate"

**This was the actual bug! Now fast updates (5-15s) will really work!**

## [1.3.2] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Options flow now triggers integration reload
- Changing update rate in options now actually applies the new rate
- Added `async_reload_entry` listener for config changes
- Enhanced logging to show current update interval in use

### Changed
- Coordinator logs now show interval: "Realtime update (5s interval): 1234W"
- Makes it easy to verify your chosen update rate is working

**Now when you change the update rate, it will automatically reload and apply!**

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Unload error**: Official `ASyncSenseable` doesn't have `close()` method
- Added `hasattr()` check before calling `gateway.close()` on unload
- Integration can now be safely removed/reloaded

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added ðŸš€
- **Separate Coordinators**: Split data updates into realtime (60s default) and trends (300s)
- **Configurable Update Rate**: Choose update interval from 5s to 5min during setup
- **Options Flow**: Change update rate after setup via integration options
- **Performance**: Trend data (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) updates separately from realtime
- **Better Architecture**: Each sensor uses appropriate coordinator for its data type

### Changed
- Realtime sensors (power, voltage, frequency) now use fast coordinator
- Trend sensors (usage/production) use slow coordinator (reduces API calls)
- Update rates are now fully customizable per user preference
- Default remains 60s for backwards compatibility

### Technical
- New `coordinator.py` module with `SenseRealtimeCoordinator` and `SenseTrendCoordinator`
- Each coordinator returns proper data dict and exposes gateway
- Options flow allows changing update rate without re-adding integration
- Better logging shows which coordinator is updating

**This enables much faster updates (down to 5s) for users who want near-real-time data!**

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Use proper exception classes from sense_energy library
- **CRITICAL**: Use executor job for gateway creation (blocks on SSL cert loading)
- **CRITICAL**: Call `gateway.fetch_devices()` before realtime update
- **CRITICAL**: Set `gateway.rate_limit` for proper API rate limiting
- **CRITICAL**: Use getattr() with fallbacks for all attribute access
- Proper exception handling matching official integration

### Added
- SENSE_CONNECT_EXCEPTIONS for connection errors
- TREND_UPDATE_RATE constant (300s for future use)
- Detailed implementation comparison document

### Changed
- Improved error messages to match official integration
- Better fallback handling when sense_energy not installed

**This release fixes all known compatibility issues with the official sense_energy library!**

### Fixed
- Realtime power data now works correctly via WebSocket connection
- No longer relies on deprecated `/status` REST endpoint

### Added

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Test alternative API endpoints to find where realtime power data moved
- Discovery that /status endpoint no longer contains power data

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-15

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Enhanced debug output in test script to show signals structure
- Detailed debugging to identify exact location of power data in new API

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **MAJOR FIX**: Updated to handle new Sense API response format
  - API now returns data nested under `signals`, `device_detection`, and `monitor_info` keys
  - Integration now correctly parses the new response structure
  - Power, voltage, and frequency data now display correctly
  - Active device detection updated for new format

### Added
- Backward compatibility with old API format (automatic detection)
- Enhanced test script to show which API format is being used

### Changed
- Real-time data parsing completely rewritten for new API structure
- Device detection updated to use `device_detection.in_progress` structure

**This is a breaking API change from Sense. All users should update to v1.1.0.**
