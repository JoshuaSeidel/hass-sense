# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.1] - 2025-10-16

### Fixed
- **Unload error**: Official `ASyncSenseable` doesn't have `close()` method
- Added `hasattr()` check before calling `gateway.close()` on unload
- Integration can now be safely removed/reloaded

## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added ðŸš€
- **Separate Coordinators**: Split data updates into realtime (60s default) and trends (300s)
- **Configurable Update Rate**: Choose update interval from 5s to 5min during setup
- **Options Flow**: Change update rate after setup via integration options
- **Performance**: Trend data (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly) updates separately from realtime
- **Better Architecture**: Each sensor uses appropriate coordinator for its data type

### Changed
- Realtime sensors (power, voltage, frequency) now use fast coordinator
- Trend sensors (usage/production) use slow coordinator (reduces API calls)
- Update rates are now fully customizable per user preference
- Default remains 60s for backwards compatibility

### Technical
- New `coordinator.py` module with `SenseRealtimeCoordinator` and `SenseTrendCoordinator`
- Each coordinator returns proper data dict and exposes gateway
- Options flow allows changing update rate without re-adding integration
- Better logging shows which coordinator is updating

**This enables much faster updates (down to 5s) for users who want near-real-time data!**

## [1.2.2] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Use proper exception classes from sense_energy library
- **CRITICAL**: Use executor job for gateway creation (blocks on SSL cert loading)
- **CRITICAL**: Call `gateway.fetch_devices()` before realtime update
- **CRITICAL**: Set `gateway.rate_limit` for proper API rate limiting
- **CRITICAL**: Use getattr() with fallbacks for all attribute access
- Proper exception handling matching official integration

### Added
- SENSE_CONNECT_EXCEPTIONS for connection errors
- TREND_UPDATE_RATE constant (300s for future use)
- Detailed implementation comparison document

### Changed
- Improved error messages to match official integration
- Better fallback handling when sense_energy not installed

**This release fixes all known compatibility issues with the official sense_energy library!**

## [1.2.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- Fixed AttributeError: 'ASyncSenseable' object has no attribute 'get_all_data'
- Added compatibility layer between official sense_energy library and custom implementation
- Properly map official library attributes to our data structure

### Added
- Comprehensive roadmap for future development
- Comparison document with official integration
- Vision for becoming the ultimate Sense integration

## [1.2.0] - 2025-10-15

### Changed
- **MAJOR**: Now uses official `sense_energy` library's `ASyncSenseable` class
- Switched from REST API to WebSocket for realtime data (official library handles this)
- Follows same pattern as official Home Assistant Sense integration

### Fixed
- Realtime power data now works correctly via WebSocket connection
- No longer relies on deprecated `/status` REST endpoint

### Added
- Automatic fallback to custom implementation if sense_energy library not available
- Better compatibility with official sense_energy library updates

**This should fix all data retrieval issues!**

## [1.1.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Test alternative API endpoints to find where realtime power data moved
- Discovery that /status endpoint no longer contains power data

## [1.1.3] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Complete recursive search of entire API response to find power data
- Raw JSON dump of response for analysis

## [1.1.2] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Debug output for monitor_info structure (where actual power data likely resides)

## [1.1.1] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Enhanced debug output in test script to show signals structure
- Detailed debugging to identify exact location of power data in new API

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- **MAJOR FIX**: Updated to handle new Sense API response format
  - API now returns data nested under `signals`, `device_detection`, and `monitor_info` keys
  - Integration now correctly parses the new response structure
  - Power, voltage, and frequency data now display correctly
  - Active device detection updated for new format

### Added
- Backward compatibility with old API format (automatic detection)
- Enhanced test script to show which API format is being used

### Changed
- Real-time data parsing completely rewritten for new API structure
- Device detection updated to use `device_detection.in_progress` structure

**This is a breaking API change from Sense. All users should update to v1.1.0.**

## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Bash script version of test tool (`test_api.sh`) - works without Python dependencies
- No external dependencies required for testing

### Fixed
- "No module named 'aiohttp'" error when running Python test script
- Test script now works in Home Assistant container environment

### Changed
- Bash script is now the recommended testing method
- Updated all documentation to reference bash script first

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Standalone test script (`test_api.py`) included in integration folder
- Built-in diagnostics support via Home Assistant UI
- DEBUG.md guide in integration folder for quick reference
- Test script now properly included when pulling updates

### Fixed
- Test script not being available after git pull/upgrade
- Made test script fully standalone (no HA environment needed)

## [1.0.3] - 2025-10-15

### Added
- Enhanced debugging and logging throughout the integration
- Detailed API response logging for troubleshooting
- Test script (`test_sense_api.py`) for direct API testing
- Better monitor and user ID validation

### Fixed
- Improved error messages for API failures
- Better handling of empty API responses
- Enhanced logging to identify data flow issues

### Changed
- Increased logging verbosity for critical operations
- Changed some debug logs to info level for better visibility

## [1.0.2] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- Fixed 400 Bad Request error for trend data endpoint
- Added fallback mechanisms for trend data retrieval
- Made trend data updates non-critical (won't fail the entire integration if unavailable)
- Improved error handling and logging for API calls

### Changed
- Trend data errors are now logged as debug/warnings instead of causing integration failures
- Real-time power data remains functional even if historical data is unavailable

## [1.0.1] - 2025-10-15

### Fixed
- Fixed 415 "Unsupported Media Type" authentication error by using form-encoded data instead of JSON
