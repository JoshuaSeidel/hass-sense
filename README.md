## Energy Dashboard Integration

This integration fully supports Home Assistant's Energy Dashboard:

1. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Dashboards** ‚Üí **Energy**
2. Click **Add Consumption**
3. Select `sensor.sense_daily_usage`
4. If you have solar, click **Add Solar Production**
5. Select `sensor.sense_daily_production`

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors
- Verify your Sense account credentials
- Check if you can log in to the Sense mobile app
- Ensure your account doesn't have 2FA enabled (not currently supported)

### Sensors Not Updating
- Check the Home Assistant logs for errors
- Verify your internet connection
- Try reloading the integration from Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services
- Check your update rate setting (too fast may hit rate limits)

### Missing Devices
- Wait for Sense to detect and learn devices (can take several days)
- Check the Sense mobile app to see if devices are detected there first
- Some devices may not be detectable due to their power signature

### AI Features Not Working
- Verify you've selected an AI provider (not "Disabled")
- Check that the conversation integration is installed and configured
- Enable debug logging to see AI calls
- Check `sense.get_privacy_info` to verify configuration

### Enable Debug Logging
```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sense: debug
```
